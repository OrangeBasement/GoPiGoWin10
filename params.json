{"name":"Gopigowin10","tagline":"","body":"# GoPiGo for Windows 10 IoT\r\nThis project was created to allow .Net programmers to develop their own projects with the GoPiGo. The GoPiGo is a robotic car for the RaspberryPi created by [www.dexterindustries.com](www.dexterindustries.com). Below are several starter solutions to help you start building your next GoPiGo Windows 10 project.\r\n\r\n### [GoPiGo Library ](https://github.com/OrangeBasement/GoPiGoWin10/tree/master/GoPiGo) and [GoPiGo nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GoPiGo/)\r\nBase library that all the GoPiGo Win 10 rojects use. Enables commutation between with GoPiGos motor controller, servos, LEDs, and more. \r\n\r\n### [GoPiGo-Controller](https://github.com/OrangeBasement/GoPiGoWin10/tree/master/GoPiGoController) and [GoPiGo-Server](https://github.com/OrangeBasement/GoPiGoWin10/tree/master/GoPiGoServer)\r\nClient (Controller) and Server for the GoPiGo. Starter solution that allows control of your GoPiGo over a LAN connection or even the internet. The Controller provides a XAML touch screen interface to control movement, servos, and LEDs.\r\n\r\n### [GoPiGo-HDMI](https://github.com/OrangeBasement/GoPiGoWin10/tree/master/GoPiGoHdmi)[Untethered: GoPiGo Client and Server on Windows 10 IoT](https://www.hackster.io/goteamgo3/untethered-gopigo-client-and-server-on-windows-10-iot)\r\nSimilar to the GoPiGo Client/Server project, the GoPiGo-HDMI solution allows control of the GoPiGo from a XAML interface that is displayed on an HDMI device. The GoPiGo must have an HDMI device plugged in as well as a USB mouse for this to work. Project is more of a proof of concept of UI control with the GoPiGo \r\n\r\n### [GoPiGo-Headless](https://github.com/OrangeBasement/GoPiGoWin10/tree/master/GoPiGoHeadless)\r\nGoPiGo-Headless is the starter project for an autonomous robot. Programmed to move randomly, this can be expanded on to react to sensors and other devices for a truly amazing robot that is self controlled. \r\n\r\n# hackster.io\r\nIn order to help GoPiGo Win10 users get started, we have created several hacksters to walk you through several of our solutions. \r\n\r\n### [Untethered: GoPiGo Client and Server on Windows 10 IoT](https://www.hackster.io/goteamgo3/untethered-gopigo-client-and-server-on-windows-10-iot)\r\n### [Windows 10 on the GoPiGo](https://www.hackster.io/goteamgo2/windows-10-on-the-gopigo)\r\n### [GoPiGo Windows 10 IoT Core Headless Application](https://www.hackster.io/goteamgo/gopigo-windows-10-iot-core)\r\n###","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
